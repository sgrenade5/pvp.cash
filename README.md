# pvp.cash

*pvp.cash is currently in development. This is a conceptual project and not yet available for real money gambling.*

## A Fair, Player-vs-Player Casino Platform

### Core Concept

pvp.cash reimagines online gambling by eliminating the house edge and focusing on player-vs-player competition. Instead of betting against a casino with built-in mathematical advantages, players compete directly against each other, with the platform taking only a small 5% commission on each pot.

### Why pvp.cash?

Traditional online casinos operate on a fundamental principle: the house always wins in the long run. Every game has a mathematical edge favoring the casino, ensuring their profit regardless of individual player outcomes.

pvp.cash takes a different approach:

- **No House Edge**: Games have no built-in mathematical advantage against players
- **Player vs Player**: All bets are placed against other players, not the house
- **Transparent Commission**: We take only a small, clearly disclosed 5% commission
- **Social Gambling**: Compete directly with friends and other players
- **Skill & Strategy**: Greater emphasis on skill, strategy, and social dynamics

### Wheel

Wheel is our first and flagship game, featuring:

- A dynamic wheel where players buy sections proportional to their bets
- Visual representation of odds through the size of each player's section
- Multi-round gameplay with persistent table balances
- Real-time updates as players place bets
- Social interaction through lobby chat

### How It Works

1. **Join a Lobby**: Select a stake level appropriate to your bankroll
2. **Buy In**: Exchange your balance for a stack of chips at the table
3. **Place Bets**: Contribute to the pot to secure your section of the wheel
4. **Watch the Spin**: See the wheel spin and land on the winning section
5. **Play Multiple Rounds**: Keep your stack and continue playing as long as you want
6. **Cash Out**: Leave the table anytime and convert your remaining stack to your account balance

### Coming Soon

- **Texas Hold'em Poker**: Classic poker with our player-vs-player, commission-only model
- **Horse Racing**: Back different horses in pari-mutuel style betting pools
- **Tournaments**: Scheduled competitions with prize pools and elimination rounds
- **Friend System**: Connect with other players and track their activity

### Join the Revolution

pvp.cash represents a fundamental shift in how online gambling works. By focusing on player-vs-player competition and transparent commission structures, we're creating a fairer, more engaging gambling environment where skill and strategy matter more than luck.

Whether you're a casual player looking for a more social experience or a serious gambler tired of fighting against the house edge, pvp.cash offers a refreshing alternative to traditional online casinos.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
